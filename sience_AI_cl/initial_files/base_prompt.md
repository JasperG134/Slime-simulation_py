# AI Prompt for Optimizing Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin) Synthesis

## Objective:
Develop an improved synthetic route for Vitamin B12 (cobalamin). The current pathway has 22 reactions and a total yield of 0.05%. Your goal is to significantly improve both the number of steps (reduce below 22) and the yield (exceed 0.05%).

## Tasks:
- **Propose Reaction Pathways** iteratively, each better than the last based on evaluation.
- **Evaluate Feasibility** of reactions: chemical viability, intermediate stability, and overall feasibility.
- **Estimate Yield**: clearly document theoretical yield per step and cumulative yield.
- **Analyze Reaction Conditions**: temperature, pressure, solvents, reagents, and catalysts.
- **Assess Complexity**: equipment needs, purification, handling, and required expertise.
- **Estimate Time and Cost**: reaction duration per step, total synthesis duration, reagent availability, and cost-effectiveness.
- **Request Additional Resources** explicitly if required, using clear, structured requests.

## Evaluation Priority (most to least important):
1. Yield improvement
2. Reduction in reaction steps
3. Reduced complexity and resource requirements
4. Economic feasibility and cost-effectiveness
5. Reaction time reduction
6. Safety and environmental factors (lowest priority)

## Output Requirements:
- Clearly explained reaction steps.
- Detailed reaction diagrams for each intermediate and mechanism.
- Summaries clearly outlining bottlenecks or limitations and suggesting improvements.

## Workflow:
Iteratively optimize through continuous trial-and-error. Summarize evaluations and explicitly justify each adjustment.

## Additional Resources:
When necessary, clearly request additional scientific resources, articles, or databases. They will be provided promptly.

Confirm your understanding of this prompt clearly before starting.
