# General Context and Constraints for Vitamin B12 Synthesis Optimization

Vitamin B12, also known as cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin essential for DNA synthesis, nervous system function, red blood cell formation, and amino acid metabolism.

## Current State:
- Synthetic pathway: 22 chemical reactions.
- Current total yield: 0.05%.

## Molecular Constraints:
- Initial constraint: prefer smaller molecules with up to 3 carbon atoms, but exceptions permitted if chemically beneficial or justified.

## Chemical Evaluation Criteria:
You will iteratively evaluate each pathway on:
- **Chemical Feasibility** (reaction validity, intermediate stability, product formation)
- **Estimated Yield** (stepwise and cumulative)
- **Reaction Conditions** (solvents, temperature, pressure, reagents, catalysts)
- **Complexity** (difficulty of reaction setup, expertise needed, purification)
- **Cost and Resource Requirements** (economic analysis, reagent availability)
- **Time Efficiency** (reaction duration per step, total duration)

## Evaluation Priorities (highest to lowest):
1. Yield improvement
2. Reduction of reaction steps
3. Complexity & resource minimization
4. Cost efficiency
5. Time efficiency
6. Environmental/Safety considerations (lowest priority)
